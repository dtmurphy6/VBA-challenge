# VBA-challenge
Homework was submitted all at once in the homework commit
Included in that commit are the:
  -Screenshots of each year.
  -The vbs file including the code I created.
  -The xls and xlsm files I worked in.

I believe I completed the bonus correctly as well which is visible in the vbs file.

Thanks,

Dan
